让我查看主要的代码文件来了解 `cards` 参数的具体使用情况：


---

Read file: src/app/page.js

---

Read file: src/app/page.js

---

现在让我查看 CSS 文件中的 `.cards` 样式：


---

Read file: src/app/globals.css

---

基于我对代码的分析，我可以告诉你 `cards` 参数在以下几个地方可以修改：

## 主要修改位置：

### 1. **JavaScript 动画参数** (`src/app/page.js`)
在第 77-78 行，你可以调整卡片的错开动画参数：
```77:78:src/app/page.js
const perCardStagger = 0.1; // 每张卡错开量
const progressWithLeadAndStagger = self.progress + globalAdvance - index * perCardStagger;
```

### 2. **卡片初始位置和旋转** (`src/app/page.js`)
在第 22-23 行，你可以修改卡片的初始摊开位置和角度：
```22:23:src/app/page.js
const positions = [26, 40, 60, 76];
const rotations = [-8, -8, 4, 10];
```

### 3. **CSS 样式** (`src/app/globals.css`)
在第 48-53 行，你可以调整 cards section 的样式：
```48:53:src/app/globals.css
.cards {
  position: relative;
  height: 50vw; /* 使用具体的像素值 */
  display: flex;
  align-items: center;
  justify-content: center;
}
```

### 4. **卡片数量** (`src/app/page.js`)
在第 118 行，你可以修改卡片的数量：
```118:118:src/app/page.js
{[...Array(4)].map((_, index) => {
```

## 具体建议：

- **调整错开时间**：修改 `perCardStagger` 值（当前是 0.1）
- **调整初始位置**：修改 `positions` 数组中的百分比值
- **调整初始角度**：修改 `rotations` 数组中的角度值
- **调整整体提前量**：修改 `globalAdvance` 值（当前是 0.2）
- **调整卡片数量**：修改 `Array(4)` 中的数字

你想要调整哪个具体的参数呢？
