<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing Next.js changes**

I need to make a change in the Next.js project. The user wants to add an h2 heading under the "Scan your sneakers, Own your cards" text with a font size of 24px, color #A6A6A6, and responsive font sizing. This implies adding a subtitle text, likely on the homepage. I’ll search for where that text exists using grep or codebase_search, specifically checking page.js for the hero section. Then, I’ll aim to modify page.js and add the appropriate styles.</details></think>

我先快速定位项目里 “Scan your sneakers, Own your cards” 这段文案出现的位置，以便在其下方插入一个新的 h2 标题，并添加相应的样式（24px、#A6A6A6、并使用百分比进行响应式缩放）。随后我会直接进行代码编辑。

---

我将搜索页面渲染处是否存在可见的 “Scan your sneakers, Own your cards” 文案（不仅是 metadata），以便在正确的位置下方插入一个 h2。随后会打开可能的文件进行编辑。

---

我将打开 `src/app/page.js` 和 `src/app/page.module.css` 查看当前结构和可用样式，以便在 `<h1>` 下方新增 `<h2>` 并添加响应式样式。随后会直接进行代码编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Implementing responsive font size**

I need to add an h2 below the text "Scan your sneakers, Own your cards" in page.js. The user specified a font size of 24px with a responsive percentage. This likely involves using CSS with font-size set to 24px at the base, then scaling it using either clamp or percentages relative to the viewport width. Although they want responsive sizing in percentages, I'll balance this with their request for a base of 24px. Perhaps something like `font-size: clamp(20px, 2.2vw, 24px)`?
**Determining responsive font sizing**

The user wants to use percentage for font size and specified 24px. Converting 24px relative to a default 16px base means it's 150% (24/16 = 1.5). However, "百分比响应" might imply using media queries for adjustments. I could define CSS with `font-size: clamp(1rem, 1.5rem + 0.5vw, 1.5rem)`, but that uses rem and vw instead of just percentages. So, I'll focus on adding the h2 with color #A6A6A6, base 24px, and leverage percentage scaling with media queries when I check `globals.css` for existing styles.</details></think>

我将查看 `globals.css` 中与 `hero` 和标题相关的样式，以便为新 `<h2>` 添加一致的样式（24px、#A6A6A6，并设置基于百分比的响应大小），然后在 `src/app/page.js` 的 `<h1>` 下方插入该 `<h2>`。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adding responsive heading style**

I need to add an h2 below the h1 text "Scan your sneakers, Own your cards," using a specific style: font size of 24px and color #A6A6A6. The phrase "字体大小百分比响应" likely refers to responsive font scaling in percentages. This suggests using a base size of 24px, and "百分比响应" could mean scaling relative to something like the viewport. In CSS, they used clamp for the h1; I might want to do something similar for the h2 or use percentage with CSS transform.
**Exploring responsive font sizing**

The user asked for a percentage-responsive font size, so I might want to use the clamp function with a minimum size of 24px while scaling up with vw or percentages. However, they mentioned "百分比," which means I should focus on percentages relative to the parent. Ideally, I’d use clamp for a middle value like 2vw. I could set it to `clamp(24px, 2.2vw, 28px)` or add a CSS class like `.hero-subtitle` for scaling. But if I do `clamp(24px, 2.5vw, 24px)`, it just remains 24px, which isn’t very flexible.
**Adding a responsive h2 element**

The user mentioned "字体大小百分比响应," which suggests I should set a responsive font size using clamp with a minimum of 24px, perhaps a mid-value of 3vw, and a maximum of around 36px. I need to add an h2 element below the h1, but they didn't specify what text to include. They referenced wanting specific text but didn't provide it. I wonder if they want something to describe a tagline. Maybe I should just leave it empty or use a neutral placeholder like "ShoeDex – Rank, Collect, Trade." However, to be safe, I might skip the placeholder altogether.
**Deciding on h2 content**

The site uses English for the h1 and for the text reveal, so I'll stick with that. A potential h2 could be "Turn sneakers into digital cards." However, since the request is to "加一个 h2 标题的字," it seems like they need an h2 element styled correctly. I could use something generic like "Transform sneakers into digital cards." I should avoid an empty h2, and instead, let's go with a succinct subtitle: "Transform your sneakers into digital collectible cards," as it aligns with the website's metadata description.
**Implementing the h2 in CSS**

I need to place the h2 element within `.hero-content`, just below the h1. I’ll create a CSS class for the h2, ensuring it has the color #A6A6A6 and is centered. In `src/app/page.js`, I plan to add:

```html
<h2 className="hero-subtitle">Transform your sneakers into digital collectible cards</h2>
```

Then, I’ll define the `.hero-subtitle` class in `globals.css`, setting properties like margin-top, font-weight (400), line-height, and a responsive font size using clamp. I’ll keep the indentation consistent in `page.js`. It’s all plain CSS and JSX, so I’m ready to apply the changes!</details></think>

我将把新的副标题 `<h2>` 插入到 `src/app/page.js` 的 `<h1>` 下方，并在 `src/app/globals.css` 中添加 `.hero-subtitle` 样式（最小 24px，使用 clamp 随视口百分比响应，颜色 #A6A6A6）。随后立即保存这些编辑。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Considering responsive font sizes**

I’m using `clamp(24px, 2.2vw, 28px)` for responsiveness, but it seems the user specifically asked for 24px. Maybe they want a fixed base size with some percentage scaling? Switching to `clamp(24px, 2.5vw, 24px)` would keep it at 24px, but isn’t necessarily correct. Their request is clear about needing a responsive size based on 24px without going larger than necessary. I'm thinking to keep it at `clamp(24px, 2.2vw, 28px)` for clarity.
**Summarizing CSS updates**

The hero CSS is set to align content in the center, and I think the text "Transform your sneakers into digital collectible cards" works fine. I need to provide a brief status update and a summary. Importantly, I've ensured the global cursor style is set to "cursor: default !important." I'll deliver a clear message in Chinese, outlining the added h2 and CSS details, also addressing responsiveness. I wonder if I should include code snippets—normally, I shouldn’t share code unless asked, but simple lines could be helpful.
**Updating on code changes**

The "citing_code" standard explains how to cite code, but since I shouldn’t include code unless requested, I'll stick to mentioning class names and files. I'll instruct them to let me know if they want to change any wording with "如果要改文案告诉我". In my status update, I’ll include a brief summary: 

- Status: I’ve inserted the h2 and added responsive styling with a base of 24px in color #A6A6A6 using `clamp(24px, 2.2vw, 28px)`.
- Files changed: `src/app/page.js` and `src/app/globals.css`.
  
I'll also ask if they prefer Chinese text or specific wording. If they want a fixed 24px, we can adjust accordingly but we'll stick with the responsive option for now.
**Summarizing scaling adjustments**

I can quickly mention that they have the option to fine-tune the scaling by adjusting the 2.2vw and the maximum settings. 

For the summary, I’ll keep it concise with bullet points while ensuring I avoid heavy formatting. Bullet lists are fine, so I’ll include minimal details without mentioning any tools explicitly. 

Alright, it’s time to deliver that summary effectively!</details></think>

- 我已在 `src/app/page.js` 中，把 `<h2 class="hero-subtitle">` 插在 `<h1>`「Scan your sneakers, Own your cards」正下方。
- 在 `src/app/globals.css` 新增了 `.hero-subtitle` 样式：基础字号 24px、颜色 `#A6A6A6`，并用 `clamp(24px, 2.2vw, 28px)` 做百分比响应缩放（最小不小于 24px）。

如果需要更换副标题文案或调整缩放幅度（例如改成更大/更小的上限，或改为更保守的 2.0vw），告诉我你想要的具体效果即可。

- 变更文件：`src/app/page.js`、`src/app/globals.css`
- 样式效果：副标题 24px 起步，随视口宽度按百分比平滑缩放，颜色 `#A6A6A6`，与现有 `hero` 区域风格一致。
