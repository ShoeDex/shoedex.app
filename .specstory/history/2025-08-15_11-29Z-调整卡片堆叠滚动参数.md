# 调整卡片堆叠滚动参数 (2025-08-15 11:29Z)

_**User**_

卡片堆叠居中后，仍需要滚动一段空间才会往下滚，调整这里的参数

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Updating file reads**

I need to give a status update without mentioning specific tool names to the user. I'll proceed to read several files in parallel: page.js, globals.css, and Card.jsx. There's also a chance that components/OptimizedShoeModel.jsx is related to a 3D shoe model. It seems like the issue might be in page.js, so I’ll focus on that for now. I'll use a multi-tool approach to read these three files.</details></think>

---

我先快速查看页面和样式代码，定位与滚动阈值/吸附相关的逻辑，然后直接在对应位置调整参数，确保卡片堆叠居中后能立即继续向下滚动，无需额外滚动距离。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting scrolling behavior**

I need to make sure that once the stack finishes in the center, the scrolling should immediately move to the footer. To do this, I'll reduce the pin end duration to match the first stage's animation end at `window.innerHeight`. I also might want to set pinSpacing to create an immediate release effect. It appears that the current setup with ReactLenis has some friction, and we already have an issue with the extra space due to the `totalScrollHeight` being three times the viewport height.
**Fine-tuning scroll parameters**

I see another potential issue with the `globalAdvance` and `perCardStagger` using `scrollTrigger`, where `end: () => "+=" + window.innerHeight` is also applicable. I think I can modify `totalScrollHeight` from three times `window.innerHeight` to just `window.innerHeight` or maybe up to `window.innerHeight * 1.2` for a little extra. The feedback suggests they want adjustments mainly to that constant. Also, it's clear that after the cards are centered, there's still a pinned time before releasing, so I should definitely set `pinSpacing` to false.
**Adjusting pinSpacing and scroll height**

I’m considering how `pinSpacing` plays a role in maintaining space for pinned content as the user scrolls. If I want an immediate release to the next section, I still need to respect that pinned space. I think the simplest approach is to change `totalScrollHeight` from three times `window.innerHeight` to just `window.innerHeight`. This will make the pinned section fit just one viewport. I’ll also keep the `scrub` duration at around 0.5. Time to implement these changes in `src/app/page.js`, ensuring I maintain the two-space indentation. I’ll double-check for any gaps when the pinned section releases.
**Running lints and applying changes**

Now that I've made some code changes, it's important to run the lints. It looks like a linter tool isn't configured, but I can use `read_lints` since it returns any existing linter errors in the modified file. Even though there aren't tests to run after the edits, I want to provide a status update before calling the tool. I’ll go ahead and apply the patch, ensuring everything is correctly implemented. Let's see what lints we might have!</details></think>

我先在 `src/app/page.js` 中把卡片区的 pin 段落长度从 3 屏降低到 1 屏（与堆叠动画一致），这样堆叠结束就会立刻释放到下一节，无需多滚一段空白。随后检查一下是否有新的语法/样式问题。

---



---



---

### 处理说明
- 我已将 `src/app/page.js` 中卡片区的固定滚动距离从 3 屏改为 1 屏：
  - 将 `totalScrollHeight` 从 `window.innerHeight * 3` 调整为 `window.innerHeight`。
  - 这样卡片在居中堆叠完成后会立即解除 pin，马上进入下面的内容区，不再需要额外滚动一段空白。

### 可能还想微调
- 如需在堆叠完成后保留一点点缓冲滚动再释放，可把值改为 `window.innerHeight * 1.2` 或 `* 1.3` 做轻微延迟。
- 若希望更快释放，`window.innerHeight * 0.9` 也可。

- 修改位置：`src/app/page.js` 中 ScrollTrigger pin 段落长度的计算。

好像滚动时会抖动

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Addressing scroll jitter**

I need to tackle jitter issues during scrolling in a Next.js app that uses ReactLenis for smooth scrolling and GSAP ScrollTrigger for animation. The jitter might come from repeatedly triggering gsap.to on updates, causing layout thrashing. It's better to use gsap.set in these cases since it avoids tween creation. The solution is to use a single timeline with ScrollTrigger and control flip progress smoothly. Plus, syncing ScrollTrigger with Lenis via scrollerProxy should help maintain that smooth experience.
**Improving smooth scroll performance**

I've noticed that when using smooth scroll with pinSpacing set to true, it can cause spacing jumps due to CSS heights. While pinSpacing: true is fine, jitter during scrolling is often resolved by employing settings like `invalidateOnRefresh: true`, `anticipatePin: 1`, and `force3D: true` on pinned elements. 

To enhance performance, I should avoid using `gsap.to` inside `onUpdate` and instead use `gsap.set` to eliminate constant tween creation. I’ll also add `will-change`, `transform: translateZ(0)`, and set `anticipatePin: 1` for the pin section. Managing the left/rotation animations should be adequate with `gsap.to` and scrub 0.5.
**Optimizing layout performance**

I see that using the `left` property can cause unwanted layout reflow; it’s better to switch to using `xPercent` for transforms since those are more performant and help reduce jitter. The initial layout is set with left percentages stacking at 50%. While refactoring to xPercent transforms might seem heavy, I can start by changing `left` to `x` or `xPercent`, keeping the initial position with `gsap.set`. Mixing `left` and translate can lead to double transforms, which isn't ideal. It looks like the most jitter might be stemming from using gsap.to in the onUpdate phase. For Lenis integration, even without scrollerProxy, ScrollTrigger should still function correctly.
**Integrating ScrollTrigger with Lenis**

To ensure that ScrollTrigger updates properly with Lenis, they need to call `lenis.on('scroll', ScrollTrigger.update)` or simply `ScrollTrigger.update()`. If they're using ReactLenis, the integration might be set up automatically. According to Lenis v1 documentation, it's important to include `gsap.ticker.add((time) => lenis.raf(time * 1000))` along with scrollerProxy.

The jitter might come from the conflict in controlling scroll, so I'll set `ScrollTrigger.defaults({ anticipatePin: 1 })` and refresh it afterward. Regarding the `scrub` value, it seems like `scrub: 0.` might just be a float notation, which still works for normal animation triggering by scroll.
**Refining animation performance**

I’m seeing that the onUpdate calls in ScrollTrigger trigger `gsap.to` twice for each card, leading to a stutter. I’ll switch to `gsap.set` to reduce the number of calls. Also, I can add optional throttling using requestAnimationFrame to minimize calculations per frame. 

I’ll update the flip logic to use `gsap.set`, add `anticipatePin: 1` for smoother pinning, and apply CSS optimizations like `will-change: transform` and `transform: translateZ(0)` for enhanced GPU performance. Once I've made these changes, I’ll patch the necessary files and run a lint check on `page.js`.</details></think>

我会优化滚动抖动问题：1) 将翻转动画的 onUpdate 从频繁创建 tween 的 gsap.to 改为 gsap.set；2) 为 pin 的触发器增加 anticipatePin；3) 在 CSS 中为翻转相关元素增加 will-change 与 translateZ(0) 以启用 GPU 合成。现在开始应用这些编辑并检查语法。

### 已做优化（减少抖动）
- **避免频繁创建补间**：将翻转回调中的 `gsap.to` 改为 `gsap.set`，只设置样式，不触发补间。
- **提升 pin 稳定性**：为卡片区的固定滚动加上 `anticipatePin: 1`，降低吸附瞬间的位移跳变。
- **启用 GPU 合成**：为 `.flip-card-inner`、`.flip-card-front`、`.flip-card-back` 增加 `will-change: transform`，并给背面加 `translateZ(0)`。

### 如仍有轻微晃动，可再试
- 将 `ReactLenis` 的 `lerp` 略调小（如 `0.12` 或 `0.1`），减小跟随滞后造成的视觉颤动。
- 给收拢过渡动画的 `scrub` 设得更稳定些，如从 `0.5` 改为 `true` 或 `0.75`。
- 确保 `totalScrollHeight` 与第一段动画 `end` 一致（当前你设为 `window.innerHeight * 1.5`，堆叠动画 `end` 还是 `window.innerHeight`，如果在 1.0~1.5 区间没有动画，会出现被 pin 但无内部动画的“空滚”，可改成一致或在 1.0~1.5 间补一点淡入/位移动画）。

需要我帮你把 `lerp`、`scrub` 和两段 `end` 做成更顺滑的一套默认参数吗？

卡片动画在默认摊开时，卡片的角度似乎不够「正」

---

_**Assistant**_

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting visual angles**

I'm exploring the meaning of "不够正," which may suggest needing an angle adjustment for a more dynamic look. The term "正" implies uprightness, so reducing rotation to approach zero seems wise. I'm proposing angles around [-10, -3, 3, 10] or similar. Additionally, I should adjust positioning for better spacing to avoid overlap, perhaps changing the positions to [12, 36, 64, 88]. I'm wondering if the transformation origin should be the center bottom for symmetry and alignment.
**Refining card angles**

I'm considering the feedback about "默认摊开时," which suggests that the card angles shouldn't have overly neat diagonal edges. Maybe a small rotateZ along with a subtle skew or 3D tilt could help. To tackle potential perspective jitter, I should give options for adjusting the rotation parameters and consider subpixel rounding by using `force3D: true`. I also want to explore code adjustments for layout mappings, like modifying the `.card` CSS to use integer pixel sizes and reducing the perspective value to minimize 3D distortion during flips.
**Interpreting card rotation**

I’m dissecting the meaning of "正," which relates to how the back of the card looks when spread out. It seems that they want the back to be visible while keeping the front hidden, and since rotation Z is applied to `.card`, it might create some perspective illusions when flipping. I plan to adjust the rotations to [-10, -5, 5, 10] and set the `.card` transformation origin to achieve a straight look. However, changing the origin may affect the centering, since the existing transforms involve translate properties. This interaction needs careful consideration!
**Balancing transforms and rotations**

I'm considering how GSAP handles transforms, keeping in mind that the default transform-origin is at the center, which affects rotation. Changing the transform-origin could help with the pivot but might misalign things with translate settings. Instead, I could rotate the `.card-wrapper` instead of the `.card` since the animation is already applied to the card itself. To address concerns about angles not being "正," I’ll adjust the rotation values to smaller magnitudes and tweak the positions to keep a symmetrical fan aspect, setting `rotationsDefault = [-10, -4, 4, 10]`.
**Refactoring code for clarity**

I’m looking to refactor the code to centralize configuration at the top by defining constants for positions and rotations, perhaps including an "uprightness" factor. I want to ensure the code maintains high verbosity and clarity while keeping the final chat minimal. I’ll adjust the `positions` and `rotations` in `src/app/page.js` and incorporate a `will-change` property in the `.card` CSS for crisp edges without overhauling too much. 

So, I'll implement these changes, run lints, and summarize the results afterward.</details></think>

我将把默认摊开状态下的旋转角度调小并更对称（-10, -4, 4, 10），并略微调整分布位置让视觉更均衡。同时为 `.card` 增加 will-change 以保证旋转更“正”。现在应用这些修改并检查。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Evaluating card animation adjustments**

The user wants the card animation to have a straighter, more symmetric look. We already made rotations smaller, but I might consider adjusting the transform-origin or Y rotation. It seems "正" suggests they want less tilt overall, which we've addressed. I could recommend increasing the 'perspective' from 100px to 800px and using 'transform-style: preserve-3d' on the card wrapper. We should check symmetrical values for equal spacing and ensure the back face rotates correctly too. I'll summarize these improvements for clarity.
**Refining card animation settings**

I want to ensure we’re adhering to guidelines without any issues. It might help to adjust the top-level perspective from 100px to a larger value, like 800px. This change could reduce distortion during the Y rotation and improve the look of the cards. Since flipping uses Y rotation, it might appear distorted when showing the back. Increasing perspective could provide a more balanced appearance, especially during the spread stage. I'll suggest this optional tweak, even if the user didn't specifically ask for it.
**Applying perspective adjustments**

The instructions indicate that I should keep going until everything is resolved. I believe adjusting the 'perspective' to 800px will help achieve the straight appearance they’re after. While the user hasn't directly requested further changes, their comment about it not looking "正" suggests they want improvement. I think it's safe to update the CSS to 'perspective: 800px' without making it too extreme. I'll implement this change now and run lints again to ensure everything's in order.</details></think>

我将进一步让卡片在摊开时看起来更“正”：把 `.card` 的 `perspective` 从 100px 增加到 800px，减弱 3D 透视扭曲。同时前面已将默认旋转角度改为更小且对称（-10, -4, 4, 10），并微调位置使分布更均衡。现在应用修改并检查。

<think><details><summary>Thought Process</summary>**Adjusting perspective settings**

I'm considering slight camera tilts with perspective-origin adjustments. The default is 50% 50%, but I could modify it to center. Also, using `transform-style: preserve-3d` on the `.card` parent seems reasonable. I should ensure the `transform-origin` is set correctly on `.flip-card-inner`, front, and back elements for proper pivoting. I'll keep angles within earlier ranges, maybe smooth them out a bit to make them straighter. Finally, I'll mention key changes and provide easily adjustable constants at the top of the function for quick revisions.
**Finalizing adjustments**

If things still aren't straight, I might need to reduce angles further or increase perspective to 1200px. Here's the final message: 

- I've adjusted rotation and positions, corrected the perspective, and addressed will-change earlier.
  
- Quick adjustment options include:
  - `rotations = [-8,-3,3,8]`
  - `perspective: 1000px-1200px`
  - Optionally, use `transform-origin: center center;`
  - Also, consider flattening 3D effects by adjusting the camera with `.card { perspective-origin: 50% 55%; }` to modify vertical vanishing.

I think I’ll keep it concise, showing knobs with code fences where it's appropriate.</details></think>

### 已做的调整
- 将摊开角度改为更对称、更小的 `[-10, -4, 4, 10]`，位置微调为 `[12, 36, 64, 88]`，视觉更“正”。
- 提高 `.card` 的 `perspective` 到 `800px`，减弱透视导致的倾斜感。
- 增加 `will-change: transform`，保证旋转更稳定、边缘更利落。

### 如果还想更“正”
- 进一步减小角度：把 `rotations` 调成 `[-8, -3, 3, 8]` 或 `[-6, -2, 2, 6]`。
- 再提高透视：将 `.card { perspective: 1000px ~ 1200px; }`。
- 可微调视点：`perspective-origin: 50% 52%`（轻微上移消除顶部轻微透视偏差）。

需要我直接把 `rotations` 再压小到 `[-8,-3,3,8]` 并把 `perspective` 提到 `1000px` 吗？

这两个参数分别指的是什么

---

_**Assistant**_

这两个参数分别控制卡片在摊开状态下的**位置分布**和**旋转角度**：

### `positions` - 水平位置分布
- `[12, 36, 64, 88]` 表示每张卡片从左到右的水平位置（百分比）
- `12%` = 最左边的卡片位置
- `36%` = 左中卡片位置  
- `64%` = 右中卡片位置
- `88%` = 最右边的卡片位置
- 这样分布让卡片在屏幕宽度上均匀展开，不会太靠边或太集中

### `rotations` - 旋转角度
- `[-10, -4, 4, 10]` 表示每张卡片的 Y 轴旋转角度（度数）
- `-10°` = 最左边卡片向左倾斜
- `-4°` = 左中卡片轻微向左倾斜
- `4°` = 右中卡片轻微向右倾斜  
- `10°` = 最右边卡片向右倾斜
- 负值表示向左倾斜，正值表示向右倾斜，形成扇形展开的视觉效果

### 视觉效果
- 位置参数让卡片在水平方向均匀分布
- 旋转参数让卡片形成扇形展开，模拟真实卡牌摊开的状态
- 两个参数配合，创造出自然的"扇形摊开"效果

如果你觉得角度还是太大，我可以帮你调整成更小的值，比如 `[-6, -2, 2, 6]` 或 `[-4, -1, 1, 4]`。
